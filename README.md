Echo Flask App Setup Guide
This document outlines how to set up and run the Echo Flask app.
Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Before starting, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.
Navigate to your project folder:

 cd path/to/your/echo-project


Create a virtual environment: On macOS/Linux:

 python3 -m venv venv
 On Windows:

 python -m venv venv


Activate the virtual environment:


On macOS/Linux:
 source venv/bin/activate


On Windows:
 venv\Scripts\activate


You should see (venv) before your command prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.


Step 2: Install Requirements
To install the necessary dependencies for your Echo Flask app, you'll need a requirements.txt file. If you donâ€™t have one, you can create it manually or generate it from your project.
Install dependencies: Assuming requirements.txt is present in your project directory, run:

 pip install -r requirements.txt
 If you don't have a requirements.txt, you can install Flask and any other dependencies manually:

 pip install flask
 You can add any additional required packages to requirements.txt for future installations.


Step 3: Modify MongoDB Settings (Optional)
In your project, the MongoDB connection details are stored in the settings.py file. You can modify the connection URL, database name, and collection names if necessary.
Locate settings.py in your project directory.


Modify MongoDB Connection URL: In the settings.py file, look for a variable like MONGO_URI that stores the connection URL to your MongoDB database. It might look something like this:

 MONGO_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017"
 You can change the URL if your MongoDB instance is hosted elsewhere or uses different credentials.


Modify Database Name: Look for a variable like DATABASE_NAME in settings.py that defines your database name:

 DATABASE_NAME = "echo_db"
 Change "echo_db" to whatever your database name is.


Modify Collection Names: Your settings.py file may also define collection names, such as:

 COLLECTION_NAME = "users"
 You can change "users" to whatever collection name you need.

 If there are multiple collections, they will be defined similarly in settings.py.


Step 4: Run the Echo Flask App
Once the virtual environment is activated, dependencies are installed, and MongoDB settings are updated (if needed), you're ready to run the Echo app.
Run app.py: In the terminal, run the following command to start the Flask server:

 python app.py


Access the Echo app: By default, the Flask app runs locally on port 5000. Open your web browser and go to:

 http://127.0.0.1:5000
 You should see your Echo app running and accessible in the browser!


Notes:
Make sure to deactivate the virtual environment once you're done working on your project:

 deactivate


If you encounter any errors during installation or running the app, ensure your Python and pip versions are up to date.
